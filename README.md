# DigitalMultimedaProject
This program is a digital escape game where you have to complete a variety of tasks in order to escape the game.

The first thing you'll need to do is download the folder. From there you will go to a specific file.

The starting point is the "StartGame.html" file. Since this was a simple project we created locally on our computers, we did not direct any traffic to a specific link.
Once in the game there are exact instructions on how to proceed through the game. Good luck.
